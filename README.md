# reddit-scraper-news-alarm
A Reddit scraper that follows news subreddits, triggering every morning (currently set to 7:45 am). Serves as a simple way to wake myself up, as well as to get up to date with recent notable affairs. This was a chance for me to explore web scraping concepts and to give myself exposure to BeautifulSoup, as well as how to create something akin to a cron. 

Need to run in the background: ``` nohup python3 NewsReader.py & ```
